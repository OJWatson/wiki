Phylogenetics / Genetic Meeting Notes 1

Assumption of what the real time tool will be based on: 

  - Starting with an aligned sequence, and looking at what real time solutions can be produced from that point, 
  - e.g. an epidemic sequence collection exists, what new questions should be being answered when new sequences are added.

Some early thoughts / ideas  
  1. Given a new sequence, a new time tree is produced. Inference that is gleaned from this new tree in terms of how it changes the previous
  tree and whether this new sequence suggests a new introduction rather than a missing contact. 
  2. Function that produces statistical elements of time trees that give indication of public health interest, e.g dense clusters of related
  sequences that are usually not associated with high incidence. 
  3. Useful to generate time trees that are limited only to plausibly rooted trees given time constraints, i.e. how to balance mutation rates
  and tree shape that rule out inplausibly ancient rooted trees. 

Basic problem to address then :

1. Given a new sequence how to create a new time tree quickly that allows ...
2. How to use series of time trees to produce statistical warnings about the epidemic, e.g. new rooting, branching parameters
3.
